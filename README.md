Description: 
This is a front-end javascript & html project for a furniture store. My application allows a user to login, search furniture items and add them to a shopping cart, then confirm and checkout on a confirmation page. My application also allows the user to see previous orders that were placed. There is no database, therefore data is simply loaded from .json files and temporary data for orders is saved and loadedde in the user's browser.

To get started:
Command line: http-server .
